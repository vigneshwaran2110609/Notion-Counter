A small project that i started to engage myself, not to forget the basics and to learn a bit more.

I use notion for keep notes and tracking many things. Its been a platform that I have used for many years. I also track the number of days since something happened or the number of days for something to happen. This helps me keep track of habits and keeps me excited about the events that i look forward for in the future.
I could use any other tracking application or counter application but i just prefer notion, so i developed this project where i can keep track of the days as well as learn something. Its completely a project that i am gonna use for myself. 

❤️
